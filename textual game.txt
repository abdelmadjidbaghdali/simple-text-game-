Welcome to the world of Valandor! Do you want to know how it all began? It all started when you were on Earth, hunched over your programming laptop like a true nerd. Suddenly, you had a heart attack and died. But then, you woke up in the world of Valandor, reborn into a really poor family with just a mother and a sister.

The most interesting thing is the legend that says in the Year of the Wolf, in the middle of the Month of the Cat, a portal will open. If you can overcome all the obstacles, you will find a treasure that no one has ever been able to claim. The people call it the ONE PIECE!

So, do you want to go on this adventure (yes/no), knowing there’s a very high chance you won’t make it back?

(no) If you never take risks, you will never achieve greatness. As a man, you must provide for your family.
(yes) Brave man, you need to pack up your stuff and get ready for this crazy adventure.
 
 Finally, the day has come, and it's time to go. You get your horse and head to the place where the portal will appear. When you arrive, you find around 100 people gathered at the spot, all eager to enter. You say goodbye to your family in a very emotional moment, and then you step into the portal.

 The moment you step into that world, you feel dizzy from teleporting and find yourself in front of a sign that reads, "Welcome to the City of Nerds," with instructions underneath stating, 
 
 "Use your brain and trust no one." 
 
 
 After walking in a straight path for some time, you suddenly come across a door with a plaque that reads, "Wealth is Power." At that same moment, a group of four people call out to you, but they don't seem like friendly companions. Now, you need to make a choice.(1.2.3)
 1.Ignoring the door and the people, you continue straight ahead to explore the place further.
 2.You decide to enter the room and see what you can find inside.
 .3You choose to go with the people, perhaps they can provide assistance or guidance.
  
// 2.1 You attempt to open the door, but it refuses to budge. With a determined push, you use some force, and with a resounding "BOMM!!!", it finally gives way. Stepping inside, you notice a chest, but it bears a message indicating that you need to solve a puzzle to open it. The puzzle reads: "I am tall when I am young and short when I am old. What am I?" (candle)
  2.2 Ah, great! This is an easy puzzle, thank God. As you take a look inside the chest, you find the legendary Great Sword of Batata. It increases your score by 3 points.
   You take it and leave the room to continue exploring the place. (hna 3awd arbte ble 1)
// 3.1  you "hi guys how  are ?"
      one of them "guys!!!  HHHHHHHHHHHH"
      you" what do you mean? "
      them "stupid "
 	Suddenly, the group surrounds you and stabs you in the back. Darkness starts to cloud your vision, and you remember the instruction from the beginning: "Trust no one." GG
 1.  Well, this is the savest  choice, but remember, "no risk, no prize." Anyway, as you continue walking, you come across the place with a waterfall surrounded by trees, offering a truly breathtaking view.	
 
 Suddenly, while exploring the waterfall, you notice some writing on a stone nearby. Curious, you approach to read it. It says, "To gain knowledge, you need to get wet." Now, you must choose one of these three options:

   1. Dive into the waterfall and search for what lies beneath.
   2.Explore the area around the waterfall for hidden clues.
   3.Ignore the writing and continue on your journey.

Which option do you choose?
1.1  You strip off your clothes and armor, then dive into the water. After a bit of searching, you discover a small cave. With determination, you squeeze your way inside and are startled to find an old man. Though nervous, you gather your courage and initiate a conversation.

You: "Old man!"

...
...
...

No response.

Then, suddenly, he speaks: "What is something that decreases as it increases?" (age)
"Why would you ask me such a question?" you wonder aloud, but the old man remains silent. Suddenly, he begins to chant words that seem to hold no meaning.

"Witness now, as the elements themselves dance to my command! Fire, rise and roar with the fury of a dragon's breath! Water, flow and shimmer with the grace of undulating serpents! Air, whirl and howl with the might of stormy winds! Earth, stand firm and tremble with the power of the earth's core!"

As he speaks, you feel yourself growing lighter and faster. Your muscles bulge, and you grow taller and stronger. You realize that he was helping you.

After thanking him, even though he doesn't respond, you make your way back to the surface, feeling significantly changed. 
After putting your clothes back on, you notice they've become much tighter and smaller, barely fitting you anymore. However, with no other choice, you continue to explore around the waterfall.
1.2// 2.1 
While exploring around the waterfall, you encounter one of your neighbors, Islam. You greet him warmly.

You: "Hey, Islam! How have you been? It's been a while."

Islam: "Hey, Ibrahim! Long time no see."

You: "Yeah, it's been great. Brother, could you provide me with some information about this place?"

Islam: "Sure thing. This place is quite tricky, so you always need to be prepared and have top-notch equipment to survive. Also, if you look over there, you'll see a cliff. Going down there could lead you to another city, but it's a risky descent because it's very high."

You: "Alright, thanks, brother. See you around."

After bidding Islam farewell, you find yourself standing before the cliff, pondering between three choices:

   1. Jump
    2.Do a backflip
    3.Give up and return home
3. man up.. anyway GG 
2/1 

As you prepare yourself to jump, you steel your nerves for the daunting height. With a deep breath, you count down. "One... two... three...!" But before you can make the leap, disaster strikes. "Ahhhhhhh! BOOOMM!!"

You groan in pain as you check your legs, relieved to find them still intact. Thankful for your survival, you realize you've sustained a serious injury to your knee, making walking nearly impossible.

Suddenly, a goblin appears, interrupting your thoughts.

Gblin(e): "Greetings, mortal traveler! Welcome to the realm of riddles and enigmas, where the mind is tested and the soul is sharpened. I am Gblin(e), the keeper of the world of mathematician. Today, you stand before me seeking passage to greater wisdom. But heed my words, for the path you seek is fraught with trials beyond measure."

Gblin(e): "To progress to the next world, you must answer this question, and beware, for a wrong answer means death, hihi."

"In a world where the past and future converge, what is the one thing that remains constant across all dimensions?"(the present)
